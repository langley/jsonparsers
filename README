This project is exploring using Scala parser combinators to parse
json. It started from code illustrated here: 
     http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combinator-parsing.html

It is a simple SBT project created using the following steps:
  1. g8 typesafehub/scala-sbt
  2. adding the project/plugins.sbt containing the eclipse plugin. 

Which allows us to use the "eclipse" command in sbt to create the
eclipse project support. 

FirstJsonParser.scala: is the first example from the url above
SecondJsonParser.scala: is the second example from the url above
ThirdJsonParser.scala: adds support for transforming the input json
  into json objects defined by the google gson library. 
FourthJsonParser.scala: moves the parser from generically parsing json
  into one that is specifically looking for an address book and
  finding it, transforms it into gson objects.
FifthJsonParser.scala: was an attempt to add failure reporting.
  However, even though it detects the error it doesn't report it. 
SixthJsonParser.scala: shows what you need to do to report failures
  and react to them. 
XpParserscala.scala: is just a very simple parser used to eXperiment
  with how to use failure() 
addressBook.json: the canonical json
a.json: basically the same as addrBook.json
aFail.json: an address book that is valid json but not a valid address
  book. 
b.json: a simple json input for the XpParser
bFail.json: a simple json input for the XpParser that will fail even
  though it is valid json.
