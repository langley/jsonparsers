This project is exploring using Scala parser combinators to parse
json. It started from code illustrated here: 
     http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combinator-parsing.html

It is a simple SBT project created using the following steps:
  1. g8 typesafehub/scala-sbt
  2. adding the project/plugins.sbt containing the eclipse plugin. 

Which allows us to use the "eclipse" command in sbt to create the
eclipse project support.
